Title: UAV Online Remote Station

Description:

This repository contains the resources and code for an online remote station for controlling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) via air-link. The project explores the feasibility and applications of remote UAV operations and includes code for both the UAV and the online remote station.

Key features of this repository include:

Django-based web interface for the online remote station with features for manual control and autonomous flight planning.
Utilization of the MAVLink and DroneKit Python libraries for communicating with the UAV.
Real-time sensor data transmission and display via the online remote station.
Python scripts for testing air-link communication, both receiving (RX) and transmitting (TX) data.
Inclusion of safety measures, such as emergency stop and return-to-launch (RTL).
Compliance with the relevant UAV regulations in Spain.
This project contributes to the advancement of UAV technology and demonstrates potential for remote UAV operations in different fields, such as agriculture, construction site surveying, and critical area surveillance. It is suitable for both beginners and experienced individuals who are interested in developing and utilizing UAV technology for personal and professional purposes.
